# Coder Assistant database, models and seed creation.

## Focus on the model creation starting with just one or two fields per model, then the seeds file. If you complete that, attempt a GET route to `/api/coder` that returns a JSON of all coders in the database (you can use Insomnia or Postman to test it).
- Using the entity relationship diagram exported from Lucid.app (see attached), create a MySQL schema using the Sequelize npm
  - Database name: `coder_assistant`
  - Only use the `coder`, `assistant` and `resource` table at this time, we will come back to the certificate and comment tables later
  - Using an M-V-C structure with Node/Express and Sequelize, create a `db`, `models` and `seeds` directory.
  - your ./config/connection.js should be used with `.env` variables as we have been using in class
  - Table relationships should be defined in the `/models/index.js` file
  - Required (NOT NULL) fields per table include `id` for each one and...
    - Coder: `display_name`, `email_address`, `password`, `role` (default = 'coder'). Visibility will be an optional string for now
    - Assistant: `type`, `name`
    - Resource: `type`, `title` 
    - Both Assistant and Resource will need the foreign key defined that relates (one to many) to the coder table
